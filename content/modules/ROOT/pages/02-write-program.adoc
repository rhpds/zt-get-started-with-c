== Write a Program

Welcome to this lab experience for Red Hat Enterprise Linux. In this Lab, you will learn how to build and run code written in C or C++ on RHEL.

A directory for your source code has been created for you. Move to the `C_source` directory by running the following command:

[source,bash,run]
----
cd /home/C_source
----

Run the following command to create a "`Hello World`" program in C:

[source,bash,run]
----
cat > helloworld.c << EOF
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
   printf("Hello World!\n");
   return 0;
}
EOF
----

If you are more comfortable creating a C++ program, use this instead:

[source,bash,run]
----
cat > helloworld.cpp << EOF
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
   cout << "Hello World!" << endl;
   return 0;
}
EOF
----

You can use shell tools like `+vim+` to edit your code in RHEL, but you
can also use popular text editors and IDEs including Eclipse, VSCode,
Sublime Text, and CLion. These make it easier to test and collaborate on
your code.
